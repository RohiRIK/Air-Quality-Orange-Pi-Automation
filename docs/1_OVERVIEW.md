# BMP688 Sensor Project on Orange Pi 3 LTS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect a BMP688 barometric pressure sensor to an Orange Pi 3 LTS single-board computer, read environmental data (temperature, pressure, and altitude), format it as JSON, and send it to a remote endpoint. The setup is containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment. The project is designed for beginners in electronics and IoT, providing a step-by-step guide to hardware connection, software configuration, and data transmission.

## Technology Stack
- **Hardware**:
  - Orange Pi 3 LTS: A compact single-board computer with GPIO pins for sensor integration.
  - BMP688 Sensor: A Bosch barometric pressure sensor module supporting I2C communication for measuring temperature, pressure, and altitude.
  - Ribbon Cable or Jumper Wires: For connecting the sensor to the Orange Pi's GPIO pins.
- **Software**:
  - **Operating System**: Armbian or Ubuntu on the Orange Pi.
  - **Programming Language**: Python 3 for the sensor reading script.
  - **Libraries**:
    - `adafruit-circuitpython-bmp3xx`: For interfacing with the BMP688 via I2C.
    - `requests`: For sending JSON data over HTTP.
    - `busio` and `board`: For I2C bus management.
  - **Containerization**: Docker to package the application and dependencies into a container.
- **Protocols**:
  - I2C: For sensor communication.
  - HTTP/JSON: For data transmission to external endpoints.
- **Tools**:
  - `i2c-tools`: For detecting and verifying I2C devices.
  - SSH: For remote access to the Orange Pi during setup.
